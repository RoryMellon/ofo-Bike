        <h1>Sheffield welcomes largest dockless bike hire scheme in the UK</h1>

      <p>A month in to Sheffield’s new bike hire scheme, run by Chinese company ofo, both the teething problems and the benefits of the scheme are now clear.  </p>

      <p>The simple, app based system gives users access to one of a thousand bikes across the city, replacing the ‘blue bike’ scheme that achieved little in terms of changing people’s commuting habits – a key aim of the project. </p>

      <p>Stewards collate usage data and distribute the bikes according to where the ‘hotspots’ are, ensuring the bikes are available in areas that see the most use. </p>

      <p>Sheffield City Council has backed the scheme as part of wider efforts to reduce air pollution in the ever expanding city, with the hope being that the bikes will provide a cheap and practical alternative to private hire cars. </p>

      <p>But, a spate of damage to the bikes has raised questions over how vandalism can be policed, and who’s responsibility this is.</p>

      <p>Stewards head out across the city to collect discarded or damaged bikes each day, but the level of vandalism has recently forced South Yorkshire Police in to saying they would refuse to pick up any more of the vandalised bikes.  </p>

      <p>Their statement read that “bike shepherding isn’t in our job description.” </p>
      <p>Bikes can be hired from wherever they have been left, with the app informing users where the nearest bike to them is via an in-app map of the city.  </p>
      <p>The lack of bike ‘docks’, as used in London’s Boris Bike system, means that the daily distribution of the bikes is based purely on data.  </p>

  <p>This pioneering approach was one of the key reasons ofo were chosen to run the scheme, according to Councillor Jack Scott, Cabinet Minister for Transport and Sustainability.  </p>

  <p>He admitted that the vandalism, which has included bikes being set on fire, was to be expected from the outset. ofo themselves responded by saying that in similar schemes in other cities, vandalism tends to die down after month one, when those involved getting bored of damaging the bikes.  </p>

  <p>“It’s really sad when people do that. I think they’ve got bored now. As time goes on the bikes will just become background, part of the furniture, and we won’t see any of it at all” he said. </p>

<p>Councillor Scott also said that schemes aimed at reducing traffic are the only viable way to keep up with the growth of the city and the ever increasing demands on roads. </p>

<p>“If we don’t do something different, we’ll get massive gridlocks and congestion. We can’t just keep adding an extra lane to the ring road every 20 years, and that means we need to see much better and cheaper public transport” he said.  </p>

<p>Users are charged 50p for every half an hour they use the bike, with no restrictions on how far they can travel in that time. The ‘Home Zone’ does restrict where you can leave the bike, however.  </p>

<p>An expansion of the scheme is planned, with more bikes to be added to the areas where usage has been at its densest. </p>

<p>“It’s no good to have a hundred bikes down at the train station in the morning if actually, everyone is going to the train station rather than leaving it”, Councillor Scott said. </p>

<p> Critics might argue that the dockless system opens the bikes up to vandalism, but ofo say the reduced cost outweighs the risk. </p>

<p> “Schemes like the Boris Bikes in London operate thanks to a huge taxpayer subsidy, and ofo can offer bike hire schemes at no cost to local authorities”, an ofo spokesperson said. <p>
